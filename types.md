## The Types of Software Documentation

In our discussion of documentation, we will focus on two overarching
categories: _Developer_ and _User_.

### But wait... aren't there more?

You may be sitting there and asking this question. Many different sources will
list various alternative types of documentation such as requirements
documentation and testing documentation.

These specific sub-types of documentation can be categorized into the two
types listed here. We provide some examples below:

| Category | Examples |
| -------- | -------- |
| Developer | Requirements documentation; testing documentation; API documentation |
| User | How-to guides; tutorials; troubleshooting guidelines |

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Can you think of more?

What other types of documentation can you think of? Do they fit into
the categories above?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Characteristics of Each Type

| Category | Intent | Target Audience |
| -------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Developer | To inform developers how to interface with a given software package throughout the entire software development lifecycle, including team processes. | Developers, stakeholders, team members, technical members of project |
| User | To inform users how to be more successful in the usage of a software package from installation to usage, including examples, troubleshooting, etc. | End-users, stakeholders |

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- "There are two primary categories for documentation: developer and user."
- "Developer documentation is intended to describe how developers should interface with a given software package."
- "User documentation is intended to help users be more successful in the usage of a software package."
